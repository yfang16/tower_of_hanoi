Tower of Hanoi game written in C++

Write a C++ program which allows the user to play the game \Tower of Hanoi" with 8 disks.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower of Hanoi for the rules of the game. We use the
following conventions.

The game is played with 8 disks of different sizes and on 3 towers labeled 1,2,3.

At the start, all disks are on tower 1 (with the largest disk at the bottom).

If the user keys in "x y" + ENTER, the top disk of tower x is moved to the top of tower y. A larger disk cannot be moved on top of a smaller disk.

The game is won if all disks are at tower 3.
